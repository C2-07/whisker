### Rules for adding a command

For the following, this assumes the name of your command is `examplecommand`

- The command definition must be at the top of the file, and be formatted as
  ```go
    var DefineExamplecommnd = &discordgo.ApplicationCommand{
    Name:        "examplecommand",
    Description: "An example command",
    Options: []*discordgo.ApplicationCommandOption{
      // put command options here
    },
  }
  ```

- The command implementation must be below the definition, and be formatted as
  ```go
  func Ping(s *discordgo.Session, i *discordgo.InteractionCreate) {

    // Command Logic & Option parsing goes here

    // Stuff for the response goes below
    s.InteractionRespond(i.Interaction, &discordgo.InteractionResponse{
      Type: discordgo.InteractionResponseChannelMessageWithSource,
      Data: &discordgo.InteractionResponseData{
        Content: "Pong!",
      },
    })
  }
  ```
  

- Every time a command is added, you must add it's definition to [definitions.go](/commands/definitions.go), and you must add it's name and impl to the switch in [dispatcher.go](/commands/dispatcher.go) (The case in the switch should be the same as the name in the command definition)
